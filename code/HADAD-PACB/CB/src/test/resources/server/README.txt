The directories xpath1 to xpath6 contains the schemas, forward and backward constraints generated by the compiler and the views used to generate such constraints and schemas.
There's a one to one correspondence between these directories and the ones on the Examples/xpath directory with the difference that the files in this directory structure where 
automatically generated using the views to constraints compiler and ready to be use by the PACB server.
