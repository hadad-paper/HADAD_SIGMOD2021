Simple test for the following view and query:

v: <streets>
      for $p in doc("input")/site/person,
          $a in $p/address
      return $a/street
   </streets>

q: /site/person/address/street/number/text()



A bit more interesting than example xpath2, since the
construction of the <streets> element requires more navigation into the view
v. This view contains a single entry, namely the root of the document.

r: Navig (v, ./streets/street/number/text ())

As opposed to xpath2, 
this version returns a rewriting in terms of the materialized v 
and compensating navigation into it, which is closer to a plan
than the rewriting in terms of the virtual view v_create.
