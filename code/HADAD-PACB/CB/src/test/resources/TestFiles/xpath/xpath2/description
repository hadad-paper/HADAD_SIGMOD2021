Simple test for the following view and query:

v: for $p in doc("input")/site/person,
       $s in $p/address/street
    return $s/text();

q: /site/person/address/street/text()



On purpose, rewriting is done in terms of v_create, because this is what was expected in problematic_testXAM2.

I will add as example xpath3 a version that returns a rewriting in terms of v and compensating navigation into it, as agreed with Francesca.
