# do not put view here, as it needs to be translated to constraints differently than
# standard view definitions are translated.
#
# just to illustrate the view, though, here goes:
#
#v<p'> :- root (r), 
#         child (r, s), tag (s, "site"),
#	 desc (s, t),
#	 child (t, p), tag (p, "person"),
#	 copy (p, p');
