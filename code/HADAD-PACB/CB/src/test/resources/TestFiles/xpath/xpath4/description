v: for $p in //person return $p/name, $p//city
q: //person/name/text()
r: Navig (v, self::name/text ())

Note that this view does not return a valid XML document tree, but rather a
forest (list of trees). v therefore is assumed to hold the set of roots
of these trees. See example xpath5 for a variation in which the view
returns a single tree, and it contains the root thereof.

Also note something very important: even though the view mixes (unions sets of)
name and city nodes in its output, 
they can be isolated via the right tag test. 
We should allow this kind of disambiguable view. Note that it compiles
to bkchase constraints differently from views with homogeneous output.
