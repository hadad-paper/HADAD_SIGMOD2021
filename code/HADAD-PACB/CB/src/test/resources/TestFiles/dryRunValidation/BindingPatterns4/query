# This example illustrates a query that can be rendedered executable only after
# exploiting an integrity constraint and several binding patterns.
# Intended query:
#
# Q(x) :- R(x);
#
# which is not executable because the only bp for R is R_i.
# All one can do with R_i is to lookup an already extracted
# value to check if it is in R_i. To execute the query we need
# to extract the lookup candidates from somewhere else, namely
# from S. The intergrity constraint states an inclusion that
# guarantees that all values of R_i are among those in S's
# first column. The problem is that S's first column cannot
# be directly extracted. Doing so requires exploiting three
# binding patterns on S: S_nno, S_noi, S_oii.

Q<x> :- R(x), D(x);
