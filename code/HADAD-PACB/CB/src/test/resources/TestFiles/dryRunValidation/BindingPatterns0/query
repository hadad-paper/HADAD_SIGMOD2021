# The intended query is simply
#
# Q<x,y> :- R(x,y).
#
# We use instead the domain-extended version below:

Q<x,y> :- R(x,y), D(x), D(y);

# This translation conforms to our result stating that
# 
# the minimal executable rewritings of a query (wrt binding patterns)
# are precisely the minimal rewritings of its domain-extended form 
# (the latter minimality is defined under the appropriate constraints
#  modeling the binding patterns). 
#
# Remarkably, this reduces the problem from rewriting under binding 
# patterns to rewriting only under constraints. Which means that
# if we have an algorithm for rewriting under constraints, we can "trick"
# it into rewriting under binding patterns even though it is unaware of
# them and does not treat them as first-class citizens.
