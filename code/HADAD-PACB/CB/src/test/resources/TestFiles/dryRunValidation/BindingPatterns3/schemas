# this example introduces several binding patterns for the SAME relation.
# binding pattern notation:
# i - stands for input
# o - stands for output
# n - neither (this position is not accessible via this binding pattern,
#              it is projected out)


# all
R(3), R_nno(1), R_noi(2), R_oii(3), D(1);

# target
R_nno(1), R_noi(2), R_oii(3);
